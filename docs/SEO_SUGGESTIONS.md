# SEO Suggestions for HealthMaster Acupuncture (Sheffield)

This document outlines quick‑win changes applied, plus broader recommendations tailored to a GP‑run, NHS‑backed clinic in Sheffield.

## Quick Wins (Implemented)
- Title: GP‑led, location‑specific, benefit‑led page title in `index.html`.
- Language: Site language set to `en-GB` for UK relevance.
- Meta description: Concise, local and trust‑based description added.
- Canonical: Self‑referencing canonical to avoid duplicate URL issues.
- Clickable contact: `tel:` and `mailto:` links added (top bar and contact section); NAP added to footer.
- Opening hours: Kept visible and consistent with NAP section.

## Local SEO (Sheffield)
- NAP consistency: Ensure the exact clinic name, address and phone match across the site, Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Apple Business Connect, and any NHS/CQC pages.
- Google Business Profile: Use categories “Acupuncture clinic” and “Medical clinic”; add services, opening hours, photos, and booking link.
- Service area: One “Areas We Serve” page referencing Sheffield neighbourhoods (City Centre, Hillsborough, Ecclesall, Crookes, Nether Edge). Avoid doorway pages.
- Map embed: Keep Google Map embed with the precise pin; link to directions.
- Local content: Add “Finding Us” details (parking, tram/bus stops, accessibility) and use descriptive UK‑English alt text for relevant images.

## Trust and E‑E‑A‑T (Medical/YMYL)
- Clinician profile: Expand GP bio with GMC number, qualifications, BMAS membership, NHS background, and scope of practice.
- Regulatory info: Include CQC registration details and link to your CQC page if applicable.
- Evidence‑based content: Where discussing conditions, reference NICE guidance and reputable sources. Keep claims measured and ASA/CAP compliant.
- Policies: Add Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Complaints Policy and Terms, linked in the footer.

## Content Strategy
- Standalone condition pages: Back pain, migraine, anxiety, fertility, shoulder/neck pain. Cover: symptoms, who benefits/contraindications, what to expect, risks, and GP perspective.
- FAQs: General and condition‑specific FAQs to capture long‑tail searches; later mark up with FAQ schema.
- Pricing clarity: What’s included, session length, and cancellation policy.

## Structured Data (Schema)
- Business schema: Add JSON‑LD using `MedicalClinic` (with `medicalSpecialty: "Acupuncture"`) and a nested `Physician` for the GP. Include NAP, openingHours, geo, sameAs (NHS/CQC), and hasMap.
- FAQ schema: When FAQs are added, mark up with `FAQPage` schema.
- Breadcrumbs: If you add more pages, include `BreadcrumbList`.

## Reviews & Citations
- Reviews: Encourage Google reviews; optionally display testimonials with consent and appropriate schema (avoid fake aggregates).
- Citations: Keep consistent listings across NHS, CQC, BMAS (if member), Yelp UK, Yell, 192.com, Apple Maps.

## Analytics & Monitoring
- GA4: Add Google Analytics 4 for engagement insights.
- Search Console/Bing: Verify domain and submit sitemap.
